This project is based on analyzing a transaction dataset using Python. The dataset contains details like transaction amount, service type, product used, city, state, and payment method. I used Python and Pandas to analyze total sales, monthly trends, customer spending, and popular services and products. I also compared credit and debit transactions and checked which states and cities have higher sales. From the analysis, I found that credit transactions generate more revenue. Exercise & Fitness is the most popular service category. Some products are purchased frequently but have low average transaction amounts, and some service categories have low performance and may need promotions. This project helped me understand how data analysis can be used to support business decisions.
